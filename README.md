# computerSecurityProgramingProject
The goal of this programming project is to implement a password authentication mechanism and a password cracker to study the vulnerabilities of choosing weak passwords. In the first part of this project, you will implement a password authentication mechanism to allow legitimate users to access their resources. In the second part, you will implement a password cracker tool that cracks system passwords through a dictionary attack. Your tool will also evaluate the strength of a chosen password, thereby guiding users to choose stronger passwords
